# A Wild Sea
2024-12-15

A simple example animation of a buoy (or a ball) floating on a wavy sea.

By Tim knapen inspired by a conversation with Antje, Nammu and Wout.

The capacitive touch sensor code included in this example is currently not being used, but is ready to go in case the waves need to be made interactive.
